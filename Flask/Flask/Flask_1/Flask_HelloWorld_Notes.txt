Steps to run Flask APPs

Got to the directory of your project and create your virtual environment for the project
py -m venv <your environment name>  

e.g py -m venv env

Here env is your virtual environment name. After you will hit enter it will create a folder with the same name as  
of your environment name (here env). After pressing enter, it will take some time so be patient.



Now activate your environment by typing:
env\Scripts\activate


It will start an env environment inside your project folder.

for e.g
(env)E:\Yourproject_Folder>

Now set your project file as FlASK_APP in the environment:

(env)E:\Yourproject_Folder>set FLASK_APP=HelloWorld.py

Here HelloWorld.py is our code file for the project.Don't name your project flask.py or Flask.py.


Now in the project folder in your virtual environment, run flask.

(env)E:\Yourproject_Folder>flask run

Flask will tell you the location where it is running it like:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Write it on your browser and it will take you there. To stop press CTRL+C on your terminal. 
You can then modify your file to add more code and try more stuff.

For our first lab we will first make a simple hello world example:

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def HelloWorld():
    return "<h1>Hello World</h1>  <br>"

Then we will run it and stop it in the virtual environment and on our browser as discussed above. After the we will insha Allah change it to:

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def HelloWorld():
    return "<h1>Hello World</h1>  <br> ISPA Flask Lab."

Then we will run it again to see if it works. Then again we will press CTRL+C to stop it.

Now type deactivate to come out of your environment.

Make another project, set environment for it and try at your own end.

(env)E:\Yourproject_Folder>deactivate
